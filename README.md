**Title:** Black Friday Sales Prediction

**Bio:** 🛒 Welcome to the Black Friday Sales Prediction project! 📈 We are a team of data enthusiasts—Sidhant Thakur (2020181), Dhruv Chandulal Dobariya (2069889), and Saransh Thakur (2020070)—under the guidance of Dr. Bamshad Mobasher at DePaul University. 

📅 Project Completion Date: November 16, 2022

📊 **Dataset Summary:**
We obtained this dataset from a reliable source, which includes a mix of categorical, numerical, and binary variables. The dataset contains 12 variables, such as User_ID, Product_ID, Gender, Age, Occupation, City_Category, Stay_In_Current_City_Years, Marital_Status, Product_Category_1, Product_Category_2, Product_Category_3, and Purchase. We have delved into the dataset, describing its attributes and understanding its structure.

🎯 **Project Goal:**
Our primary goal is to construct a prediction model to discern user purchase behavior during Black Friday sales. This model will enable us to tailor offers effectively.

🔍 **Methods Used:**
We have explored various approaches, employing Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, and XGBoost Regressor. Our journey involved data cleaning, exploratory analysis with insightful visualizations, and data splitting into test and train subsets.

📈 **Conclusion:**
Here are some key findings:
- Males exhibit more interest in Black Friday sales than females.
- The 26-35 age group is the most active.
- Unmarried participants account for 59.09%.
- Product categories are diverse.
